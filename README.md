```c++
#ifndef ADVENT_OF_CODE_H
#define ADVENT_OF_CODE_H

#define YEAR 2020

void wishes() { return "Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!"; };

#endif /* ADVENT_OF_CODE_H */
```

This repository will be used to store my solution to all the puzzles using C++ only. Please consider that these might not be the fastest/simplest solutions. They're merely my solutions.
